Current Commit:
	CHANGED: Grid.cpp: removed using directive
	REMOVED: Unused mBoardPos member from Game
	FIXED:   Clicks in the grid now take in consideration which position the entire grid is in
	Make sure clicks in the grid are calculated correctly
	
TODO:
	
	Make most/all the tileIndex stuff into Tile* instead
	
	Remove temp shapes from Tile::Draw, they should probably be structured better
	
	Turn logic:
		Make sure tiles get reset with each turn
		Make sure Players don't see info from other players turns
		
		Draw indicators for moves
